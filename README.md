## What is LikeParser
LikeParser is a free + API-free tool that extracts LinkedIn post interactions with zero setup. Instead of dealing with APIs, simply scroll through your LinkedIn post likes, copy the list of interactions, and paste them into the LikeParser folder. The tool automatically organizes the data, extracting user names, engagement types (like, celebrate, insightful, etc.), and other relevant details into a structured format, ready for analysis or lead generation. It also tracks who interacts with your profile the most, creating a special field that highlights your most engaged users, making it easier than ever to identify your top supporters and potential leads.
