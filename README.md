## What is LikeParser
LikeParser is a smart automation tool that turns your LinkedIn engagement into a goldmine for Marketing and Sales. It scrapes data from your LinkedIn profile or page and generates a detailed report with post-level insights — showing how each post performed and highlighting your top-performing content in terms of audience engagement.

But it doesn’t stop there — LikeParser also builds a ranked database of every user who interacted with your content, giving your Sales team a warm lead list ordered from most to least engaged. It’s a simple, powerful way to turn likes into leads.

Oh, and the best part? It’s completely free. LikeParser was designed to work without paying for LinkedIn’s API — no subscriptions, no tokens, just results.

## How It Works? 
1. Scroll through your LinkedIn post likes.
2. Copy the list of interactions.
3. Paste them into the LikeParser folder.
4. Run the tool and watch it organize the data for you.
